# Release Notes

## Vanilo 0.2

Vanilo v0.2 has been released on Feb 19, 2018.

From now on there will be an upgrade path to the upcoming versions (0.3, etc).
This version adds support for Laravel 5.6, fixes bugs and adds improvements to the cart.

The roadmap has been slightly modified, as some parts planned for v0.2 have been moved to v0.3,
which has been forwarded to March 2018.

## Vanilo 0.1

Vanilo v0.1 was the very first Vanilo release ever (Dec 11, 2017).
Consider it as a **TECHNOLOGY PREVIEW**.

This version is not yet ready to create applications with. Feel free to
discover it, play with it, and
[submit issues on github](https://github.com/vanilophp/framework/issues).

Please mind that in its current state Vanilo:
- lacks many features,
- features are incomplete,
- there are shortcuts, bugs, TODOs and other nasty things in the codebase,
- even basic concepts are subject to change,
- 0.1 is not intended to be upgradable to v0.2.

Beginning with version 0.2 Vanilo will provide a documented upgrade path
up to the 1.0 stable release. For more details refer to the
[Roadmap](roadmap.md).
