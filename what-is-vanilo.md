# What Is Vanilo?

Vanilo is an E-commerce Framework for Laravel. It's like Magento or Sylius.

## Is It Ready For Production?

**FOR EARLY ADOPTERS ONLY**. Vanilo 0.2 - as its version number shows - is still in development stage.
But as promised, starting from v0.2 there will be an upgrade path up to v1.0.

Refer to [Release Notes](releases.md) for more details.

## Why Another E-commerce Package?

Shortly, because in 2017 there was no decent one **especially for
Laravel**. There's a slightly longer

about why it came to life.
