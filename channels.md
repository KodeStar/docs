# Channels

In today's E-commerce the shop site is no longer the only point of sale.

Channels represent a single sales channel, which can be one of the following things:

- Website
- Mobile application
- Cashier in your physical store
- Facebook integration,

or pretty much anything similar you can imagine.

Many E-commerce businesses run multiple sites and/or brands, working with the same set of products and infrastructure.
Such "brands" are typically also channels.

This feature in Vanilo is quite unfinished yet. It needs to be integrated with orders/checkout in order to be fully functional.

Typically you can define per channel:

- different set of available products
- different currencies and/or prices
- available language(s)

In the end, each of your orders should be aware of which channel has it been placed, therefore you can measure
the performance of each sales channel.
