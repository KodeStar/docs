# What Is Vanilo?

Vanilo is an E-commerce Framework for Laravel. It's like Magento or Sylius.

## Is It Ready For Production?

It depends. The current feature set is not yet enough to run a "usual" Webshop in 2018. But what
Vanilo already provides is stable, tested and extensible.

Starting from v0.2 there has been a well defined [upgrade path](upgrade.md) up to v1.0.

Thus it is possible to build a Webshop on Vanilo 0.4 - even if it doesn't have a stable version
number yet.

Refer to [Release Notes](releases.md) for more details.

## Why Another E-commerce Package?

Shortly, because back in 2017 there was no decent one **especially for Laravel**. There's a slightly

about why it came to life.
