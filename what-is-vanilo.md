# What Is Vanilo?

Vanilo is an E-commerce Framework for Laravel. Vanilo to Laravel is like Magento to Zend or Sylius
to Symfony.

## Is It Ready For Production?

Yes.

Starting from as early as v0.2 there has been a well-defined [upgrade path](upgrade.md) up until the
current latest version.

Refer to [Release Notes](releases.md) for more details.

## Why Another E-commerce Package?
