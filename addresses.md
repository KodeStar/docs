# Addresses

The Address module adds support for countries, provinces (state, county,
region, etc), cities and addresses.

The Vanilo framework uses the
[konekt/address](https://github.com/artkonekt/address) library. If using
only some components of Vanilo, it's possible to use a different
implementation, the only requirement is to implement the
`Vanilo\Contracts\Address` interface.

Please refer to the original address documentation for more details:
