> The Attributes Module is WIP at the moment and will be released in [Vanilo v0.5](roadmap.md).

## Overview

Product attributes track individual properties of a product which donâ€™t apply to all products.

Examples of product attributes are:
 - **material** of a _T-Shirt_,
 - **color** of a _Smartphone_,
 - **RAM size** of a _Laptop_,
 - **alcohol %** of a _Spirit drink_,
 - whether a _Fridge_ **has display**.
