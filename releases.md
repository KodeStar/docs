# Release Notes

## Vanilo 0.2

Vanilo v0.2 is the upcoming release in Feb 2018.

## Vanilo 0.1

Vanilo v0.1 which is the very first Vanilo release ever (Dec 2017), and
we consider it as a **TECHNOLOGY PREVIEW**.

This version is not yet ready to create applications with. Feel free to
discover it, play with it, and
[submit issues on github](https://github.com/vanilophp/framework/issues).

Please mind that in its current state Vanilo:
- lacks many features,
- features are incomplete,
- there are shortcuts, bugs, TODOs and other nasty things in the codebase,
- even basic concepts are subject to change,
- 0.1 is not intended to be upgradable to v0.2.

Beginning with version 0.2 Vanilo will provide a documented upgrade path
up to the 1.0 stable release. For more details refer to the
[Roadmap](roadmap.md).
