# What Is Vanilo?

Vanilo is an E-commerce Framework for Laravel. It's like Magento or Sylius.

## Is It Ready For Production?

**NO, NOT AT ALL**. Vanilo 0.1 is a TECHNOLOGY PREVIEW.

Refer to [Release Notes](releases.md) for more details.

## Why Another E-commerce Package?

Shortly, because in 2017 there was no decent one **especially for
Laravel**. There's a slightly longer

about why it came to life.
