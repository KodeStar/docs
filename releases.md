## 0.3
##### 2018-08-19

- Product images
- Custom Product attributes in cart
- Settings/Preferences in admin (arbitrary settings can be added)

## 0.2
##### 2018-02-19

- Starting with v0.2 there is an upgrade path to the upcoming versions (0.3, etc).
- Support for Laravel 5.6,

The roadmap has been slightly modified, as some parts planned for v0.2 have been moved to v0.3,
which has been forwarded to March 2018.

## 0.1
##### 2017-12-11

Vanilo v0.1 was the very first Vanilo release ever.
Consider it as a **TECHNOLOGY PREVIEW**.

This version is not yet ready to create applications with. Feel free to
discover it, play with it, and
[submit issues on github](https://github.com/vanilophp/framework/issues).

### What's in it:

- Concord (foundation for customizing E-commerce components)
- Customers
- Products
- Cart
- Checkout
- Orders
- Admin
    - Users
    - Acl (permissions, roles)
    - Extendable

Please note that Vanilo as of v0.1:
- lacks many features,
- features are incomplete,
- there are shortcuts, bugs, TODOs and other nasty things in the codebase,
- even basic concepts are subject to change,
- 0.1 is not intended to be upgradable to v0.2.

Beginning with version 0.2 Vanilo will provide a documented upgrade path
up to the 1.0 stable release. For more details refer to the
[Roadmap](roadmap.md).
